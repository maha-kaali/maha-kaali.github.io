# **About Me**

Hi I am <b>Jayasree </b>:wave:,<br>
<p align="justify">
Part builder, Part thinker, Full-time curious human. <br><br>
I’m drawn to the kind of problems where AI has to make decisions, learn on the fly, or outsmart chaos (especially when security’s on the line). My current fascinations include reinforcement learning, autonomous agents, and the space where machine learning meets cybersecurity.<br><br>

I don’t claim to have all the answers—just a growing list of questions and the drive to chase them down. Whether it’s a stubborn bug, a fuzzy idea, or a weird edge case, I’m usually the one poking at it until it makes sense.
